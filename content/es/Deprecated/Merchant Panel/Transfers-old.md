## Bank Data
In this section you can verify and edit your bank details. Your main bank account will be automatically linked to your PayU account upon registration. This is the account that will receive most of your transfers.

1. Choose this option by clicking on _**Bank Data**_ in the _**Transfer**_ menu where you will find main bank account details. You can change this bank account, edit details and attach a supporting document confirming this account is registered under the same person that holds the PayU account.

2. Once you have registered new bank details, PayU will validate the information. While this process is taking place you can still make transfers to your previous bank account. This icon <i class="fas fa-clock" style="color:#e09222;"></i> indicates that your new account is still being validated. A green icon <i class="fas fa-check-circle" style="color:#a6c307;"></i> indicates that your new account has been verified and you will be able to make transfers to the new main account.
