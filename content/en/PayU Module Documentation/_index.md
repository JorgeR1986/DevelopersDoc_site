The PayU module is the system where you can securely manage your account. In this module, you can change your password, get sales reports, find the data needed to integrate your website with our platform, use tools to receive payments, and transfer money to your bank account.
PayU module is ideal for businesses that need to:

* Keep control of their stocks and sales performed through PayU.
* Be updated with the information of the financial movements of their account.
* Make requests to the support team about issues in their account.

## PayU module concepts
The PayU Module allows a user to manage the merchant and its related accounts.  The complexity of your PayU module depends on your size. Let's explain this using the following concepts.

* **Merchant**: the merchant is the store that offers products or services. PayU defines the merchant as the legal person who hires the PayU service. If your store is legally constituted in two countries (two legal entities), each legal entity must be created as a merchant.<br>For example, _Shop ABC_ has branches in Mexico and Colombia, but the shop has constituted one company in each country, when _Shop ABC_ hires the PayU services, PayU creates two different merchants.

Each merchant in PayU has a unique `Merchant ID`.

* **Account**: an account in PayU represents a processing country, a business line, or a hired PayU feature of a given merchant. If your shop is legally constituted in a country and sells products in many countries, you have a single merchant (your shop) in which you find an account per each country.<br>For example, _XYZ systems_ is a company legally constituted in the United States who offers the services of web hosting in Colombia, Mexico, and Peru. When _XYZ systems_ hires the PayU services, PayU creates a merchant with three accounts.<br>Moreover, an account is also one of the following:
  - A business line: when a merchant has many different business lines in a given country. For example, a software company can offer their product as one business line and the training as another. In this case, this commerce has two accounts.
  - A feature: if you hire two PayU features with a different pricing schema, each feature is represented in your PayU module as an account. For example, a shop has one price to process with credit cards and one different when they process with cash payments.
* **User**: a user is a person who has a profile to manage or consult the information of an account.<br>A profile is a set of permissions to access an account. A user can have one or multiple profiles, this means that a user can access multiple accounts and multiple merchants.

The following graphics show the relation between the concepts above.

#### Multi merchant shop
The shop _Shop ABC_ has branches in Mexico and Colombia, both are legally constituted as _Shop ABC Mexico_ and _Shop ABC Colombia_, this is the relation between the previous concepts for this example:

<img src="/assets/MerchantPanel/MerchantPanel_Concepts1.png" width="50%"/><br>

* The PayU module for _Shop ABC_ has two merchants: _Shop ABC Mexico_ and _Shop ABC Colombia_, each merchant has an account as they process only in the country where they are constituted.

* _Shop ABC_ has four users; **User 2** and **User 3** can access both accounts, meanwhile **User 1** can only access the Colombian account and **User 4** to the Mexican account.

In this case, each merchant may have multiple accounts, if required.

#### Single merchant shop with multiple accounts
_XYZ systems_ is a company legally constituted in the United States who offers the services of web hosting in Colombia, Mexico, and Peru; in addition, _XYZ systems_ has two business lines in Colombia: web hosting and training. This is the relation between the previous concepts for this example:

<img src="/assets/MerchantPanel/MerchantPanel_Concepts2.png" width="50%"/><br>

* The PayU module for _XYZ systems_ has a single merchant as they are legally constituted in the United States. As _XYZ systems_ processes in three countries, this merchant has four accounts; two for Colombia (one per each business line), one for Mexico and one for Peru.

* _XYZ systems_has four users; **User 3** can access all the accounts, meanwhile, the other users can access their assigned country.

Merchants can be outside of our processing countries. Nevertheless, they must have an intermediary bank account in each country they want to process.

#### Single merchants with single accounts
This is the most common case when using the PayU module. A shop is legally constituted in a country where it offers its products or services, this is the relation between the previous concepts for this example:

<img src="/assets/MerchantPanel/MerchantPanel_Concepts3.png" width="50%"/><br>

* The PayU module for this shop has a single account and a single merchant, where all its users can access according to the profile they have.
