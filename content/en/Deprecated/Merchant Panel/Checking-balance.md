* _**Total balance**_: The total funds received from your sales, after deducting the commission of PayU.
* _**Reserve balance**_: For security reasons, all PayU accounts temporarily reserve a part of the balance as collateral. During this time, the money cannot be transferred to your bank account. This percentage is determined by your business activity and the judgment of your account representative. If you want to see the percentage of reserve balance applied to your account, please write to sac@payulatam.com.
* _**Available credit**_: The money you can transfer to your bank account. It consists of the available credit minus the reserve balance.
