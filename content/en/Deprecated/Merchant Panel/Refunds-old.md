## What is a refund?
A refund is made every time a business voluntarily decides to refund the money spent to the cardholder due to the following reasons:  
* The client does not like the product and returns it.
* The businessâ€™ stock is depleted and it is not able to deliver the product to the client.
 
## How to carry out a refund?
To proceed with a transaction refund, the following steps must be completed. The transaction must be _**approved**_ and free of any pending dispute process.

1. **Consult the transaction that you want to refund**:<br>
To verify a transaction, you must go to the administrative section on the _**Report**_ menu, then select _**Transactions**_ option and look for the specific operation to reimburse based on the money spent during the purchase.

2. **Submit the request of refund**:<br>
After identifying the transaction, you can expand it to see more details and be sure of continuing with the process. If in effect this is the right transaction, you have to click the _**Refund**_ button located in the _**Transaction detail**_ section.

<sup>\*</sup> _Partial reversal_: if the amount regarding the requested partial reversal exceeds the total of the transaction, you will not be able to proceed with partial refund. You must also consider that the current transaction may be affected by other partial reversal requests.

Partial reversals only apply to Brazil, Peru and Argentina.
