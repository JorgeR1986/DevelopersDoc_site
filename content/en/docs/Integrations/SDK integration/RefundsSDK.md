You can create the refund request using the _Refund_ or _Void_ method. Once you have created the request, a PayU customer service agent validates the information and the justification of the request to approve it and perform the refund, or deny the request if it does not meet the requirements.
Additionally, you can check the status of your refund request using the [Query SDK]({{< ref "queriessdk" >}} "Query SDK") available for that purpose.
