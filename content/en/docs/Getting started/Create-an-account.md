To activate your account, you should:
- Have completed the documentation and registration in the administrative module.

After you have created an account, you and your customers receive a notification for each payment they made. The money is then credited to your PayU account. 

According to your business needs, select how to integrate your shop with the PayU services and tools. For more information, refer to [Integrations]({{< ref "integrations" >}}).
