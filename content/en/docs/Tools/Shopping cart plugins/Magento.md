## Considerations
* Approved payments appear with _Processing_ status in the orders report.
* Once the payment is received correctly, Magento creates an invoice with the associated order.

## Installation
Follow the next procedure to install the plugin on your website.

1. Log in to your Magento admin panel. Then, expand the _**System**_ menu at the top and click _**Cache Management**_.<br>
In the new window, click _**Flush Magento Cache**_.

3. Navigate to ***[PluginFolder]\app\code\local*** and copy the **Gfgrisales** folder into the ***\app\code\local*** folder in the root of the Magento installation folder.<br>
If this structure does not exist in your installation, create it with read and write permissions.

* **Merchant ID**: ID of your commerce in PayU Latam.
* **APIKey**: Unique key of your commerce, you can get this information in your PayU Module (**_Settings_** > **_Technical configuration_** > **_API Key_**).
* **Account ID**: ID of the PayU account according to the country where you want to sell.
* **Gateway URL**: Gateway URL.
  * For test, use https://sandbox.gateway.payulatam.com/ppp-web-gateway

For testing purposes, you can use the **Merchant ID**, **APIKey**, and **Account ID** available in [Test Your Solution]({{< ref "Test-your-solution.md" >}}).

Once you are in the credit card payment form, and ensuring that you have the message at the top of the gateway _Transaction in test mode_, you must:

* Enter the text `APPROVED` in the Full Name field if you want the transaction to be approved, `REJECTED` if you want it to be rejected or `PENDING` if you want it to be pending.
* You must enter a valid card number in the Card Number field according to the selected franchise. For this, you can use an online credit card generator.
* All other fields can be random.

At this point, your customers can pay with PayU Latam when they do the checkout in the Magento's shopping cart.
