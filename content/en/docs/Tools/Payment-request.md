You can choose to receive a total payment or send your customers a detailed description of the sale. You can send your payment request via email or generate a link to share it in chat rooms or social networks. Once your customer receives it, they can make the payment through our secure payment system.

With the Payment Request, you have the following benefits:
* Sell online regardless if you don't have a website using email, social networks or, message exchange platforms.
* Offer several payment methods.
* Discriminate the payments you receive so you can know who pays what and when.

## How does the Payment request work?
The Payment request follows a simple flow to let your customers buy your products or services using the secure PayU platform:

1. Generate the Payment request through the PayU module. For a basic payment request, you only need to provide what you want to sell, its price, and decide whether your payment includes taxes or an expiration date. If you want to include additional information such as shipping, payment reference, comments, and more, you can create a Custom payment request.

2. Once the link has been generated, you can share it with your customers either by email, posting the link on social networks, or including this link in your website (if you have one).

3. When your customers use the link, they are redirected to the PayU's checkout page, where they can pay using any of the [available payment methods]({{< ref "Select-your-payment-method.md" >}}).

4. Every time a customer pays using the link, you receive a confirmation message and the amount of the purchase<sup>*</sup> is transferred to your PayU account, where you can transfer it to your bank account.

<sup>*</sup>_The value transferred corresponds to the amount paid by your customer minus the PayU fee._

## Creating payment requests
According to your business needs, you can create  two types of Payment requests: Basic and Custom.

A _Basic Payment Request_ lets you create a link just by providing the product's name and price; furthermore, you can decide whether you need to include taxes or whether the link may expire in the future. The _Custom Payment Request_ is a payment link with extra information such as shipping information, payment reference, response pages, comments or narrow down the available payment methods.
