PaymentsOS then assumes that the transaction has been voided and sets the payment status to <code>Voided</code>. However, since the status of <code>Approved</code> is an acknowledgement of receipt only, it does not reflect the final status of the transaction (for instance, the Void operation may have been declined). To view the transaction&apos;s final status, you must thus check the daily decline report that you receive from Vantiv.</li><li>Vantiv recommends to leave at least a one minute &apos;processing time gap&apos; between the POST Authorize and POST Void requests.</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
