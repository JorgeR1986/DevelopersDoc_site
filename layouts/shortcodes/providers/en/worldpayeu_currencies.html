<p>Worldpay supports many <a href='http://support.worldpay.com/support/kb/gg/corporate-gateway-guide/content/reference/usefultables.htm#ISO' target='_blank'>currencies</a> (click the link and see <b>ISO currency codes</b>), but not all currencies are supported by all providers. Contact <a href='http://www.worldpay.com/global/support/' target='_blank'>Worldpay support</a> for provider-specific currency details. <p>Note that Worldpay cannot process amounts in IDR that include decimal numbers. For payments in IDR, you should therefore not pass any decimal values.<p>Bear in mind that PaymentsOS requires you to pass amounts in <a href='/docs/minor-currency-units.html' target='_blank'>minor units</a> (this means that the last two digits of the amount are decimals). Since Worldpay cannot process amounts in IDR that include decimal numbers, you must make sure that the last two digits of the amount in minor units are always 00.  For example, you can pass an amount of 1000; you cannot pass an amount of 1010.</p>
